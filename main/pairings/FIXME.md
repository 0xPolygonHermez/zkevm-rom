- [ ] $\mathbb{F}_p$ arithmetic fails if the input is a negative big integer, we should fix this! It's working properly otherwise
- [ ] Think and fix edge cases
- [ ] Unify inverse Fp2 and Fp2 arithmetic in general
- [ ] Implement fast square and fast exponentiation in the 12-th cyclotomic subgroup as per https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/542.pdf
- [ ] Rename `Fp2BN254neq0` in `helper.js` to `FpBN254neq0`
- [ ] Why is `${const.BN254_P - C} => C` correct and `%BN254_P - C => C` is not?
- [ ] Fix all Check if 0!!!! I should use EQ rather than ARITH
